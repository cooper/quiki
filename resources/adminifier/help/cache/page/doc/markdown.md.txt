            In addition to pages written in the quiki source language,
            quiki can serve content rendered from
            Markdown.
        
        
            Markdown files are stored alongside .page files within the wiki page directory.
            They are identified by the .md file extension.
        
        
            Rather than simply injecting the Markdown content as HTML, quiki translates
            Markdown files to the quiki source language on the fly. Although this
            generated page source is never stored or exposed to where you would see it,
            translation ensures that pages rendered from Markdown are formatted exactly as
            would be those written directly in the quiki source language.
        
        
            quiki uses blackfriday
            with extensions
            enabled to closely resemble
            GitHub Flavored Markdown.
