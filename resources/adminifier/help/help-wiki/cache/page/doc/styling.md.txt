            Styling
        
        
            quiki provides a simple solution to styling with CSS from within the wiki
            language. Rules can be added to specific blocks and/or children of specific
            blocks, and selectors like classes and block types can also narrow down the
            matched elements.

                    A style block with no selector will be applied to the parent block.
                
imagebox {
    file:   some-image.png;

                    If selectors are specified, the styles will apply to the block's children
                    which satisfy them.
