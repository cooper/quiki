# Styling

quiki provides a simple solution to styling with CSS from within the wiki
language. Rules can be added to specific blocks and/or children of specific
blocks, and selectors like classes and block types can also narrow down the
matched elements.

* [Styling](#styling)
    * [Rules for one block](#rules-for-one-block)
    * [Rules for a block's children](#rules-for-a-blocks-children)

### Rules for one block

A style block with no selector will be applied to the parent block.

```
imagebox {
    file:   some-image.png;
    width:  500px;
    style {
        padding: 5px;
        background-color: red;
    }
}
```

### Rules for a block's children

If selectors are specified, the styles will apply to the block's children
which satisfy them.

All children
```
sec {
    style [*] {
        margin: 50px;
    }

    First paragraph. First paragraph. First paragraph. First paragraph.
    First paragraph. First paragraph. First paragraph. First paragraph.

    Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph.
    Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph.
}
```

Children matching a class
```
sec {
    style [.padded] {
        padding: 50px;
    }

    First paragraph. First paragraph. First paragraph. First paragraph.
    First paragraph. First paragraph. First paragraph. First paragraph.

    p.padded {
        Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph.
        Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph.
    }
}
```

All children plus the parent
```
sec {
    style [this, *] {
        margin: 50px;
    }

    First paragraph. First paragraph. First paragraph. First paragraph.
    First paragraph. First paragraph. First paragraph. First paragraph.

    Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph.
    Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph.
}
```
